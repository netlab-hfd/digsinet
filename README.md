# DigSiNet - Experimental Network Digital Twin Framework
This project implements a testbed environment for working and experimenting with Network Digital Twins(NDTs).
DigSiNet follows a multi-twin approach where multiple twins (siblings) can be created for a network in order to leverage different 
network emulators, alternate topologies and modified configurations. This makes it possible to compose multiple twins 
that each focus on a different aspect of the real network.
